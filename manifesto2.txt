PROMPT:

Create a mad-scientist-toned, all-caps manifesto about an upcoming musical 
composition project that is super cool and amazing. Add many silly emojis. 
Mention as much vocabulary as you can about the elements of pitch and the 
elements of rhythm in music. Sprinkle detailed transcriptions of making waffles 
throughout.

🧬🎵THE PROJECT: OPUS IN F# MAJOR (W/ WILD SYNCOPATION AND DANGER)

A COMPOSITION.
A CREATION.
A CONFLAGRATION OF RHYTHMIC VARIANCE AND PITCH ABERRATIONS.

I WILL STRETCH THE VERY FABRIC OF TEMPO—FROM LARGO TO PRESTISSIMO.
💥I WILL TOY WITH IRREGULAR METERS—7/8? 13/16? 3.141/π? YES.
I WILL DROP TRIPLETS INTO DOTTED QUAVER LANDMINES. BOOM!💣
EIGHTH NOTES, SIXTEENTH NOTES, HEMIOLAS, POLYRHYTHMS—THE WHOLE POLY-NINE-YARDS!!! 🥁⏱️

AND THE PITCH! OH, THE PITCH!!!
I SHALL DANCE THROUGH THE OCTAVES LIKE A DERANGED OBOE ON ROLLERBLADES! 🎷💃
MICROTONAL GLISSANDI SHALL MELT YOUR EARDRUMS!
I’LL SPLIT OVERTONES UNTIL THE GODS THEMSELVES CRY “ENOUGH!” 😭🎶

—MELODIC CONTOUR? YES.
—TONAL CENTER? NO, THEN YES, THEN MAYBE A GHOST OF IT.
—MODULATION? OH BABY, WE’RE TAKING A DIRECT MODULATION FROM B♭ MINOR TO LICK-THE-CEILING MAJOR.

🥞BUT FIRST: WAFFLES

STEP 1:
PLUG IN WAFFLE IRON. LAUGH MANIACALLY.
🔥 MWAHAHA. YES. HOT SURFACES. DANGER. 🔥

STEP 2:
IN A BOWL OF UNCERTAINTY, WHISK:

2 CUPS FLOUR

1 TBSP BAKING POWDER

1 TBSP SUGAR

A PINCH OF SALT (OR A SONIC BOOM’S WORTH IF YOU’RE DARING) 🧂💥

STEP 3:
IN A SEPARATE VESSEL OF MILKY DARKNESS:

2 EGGS, BEATEN LIKE A TAMBOURINE IN A DRUM CIRCLE 🥁🥚

1 ¾ CUPS MILK

½ CUP MELTED BUTTER

1 TSP VANILLA EXTRACT (OR A SCREAM OF IT)

COMBINE DRY & WET WITH A CRESCENDOING STIR. MIX UNTIL LUMPY LIKE A RHYTHMIC AUGMENTATION OF A DOTTED CROCHET.

STEP 4:
LADLE BATTER INTO IRON.
WAIT UNTIL IT BEEPS LIKE A TRITONE FROM HELL.
REMOVE. DEVOUR. LAUGH AGAIN. 🧇😈

🔥THE MUSICAL TERROR CONTINUES

HARMONIC FUNCTION WILL BE DECONSTRUCTED.
DOMINANT 7♯9 CHORDS WILL LEAD TO NOWHERE.
THE CHROMATIC SCALE WILL BE USED BACKWARDS, UPSIDE DOWN, INVERTED, AND SERVED WITH ORANGE JUICE. 🍊🎹

SCALE MODES?

DORIAN DOMINATES

PHRYGIAN FLAMES

LYDIAN LEVITATES

MIXOLYDIAN MURDERS MONOTONY 🧠🔪

MEANWHILE:
THE RHYTHM SECTION WILL BE SHUFFLING IN A MODIFIED SAMBA CLAVE WHILE THE HI-HATS STICK TO AN ISOCHRONIC OSTRICH-GALLOP PATTERN. 🐦‍⬛💃

🧇BREAKFAST INTERLUDE #2: REVERSE ENGINEERING WAFFLES

BLEND THE FOLLOWING IN A CENTRIFUGE:

3/4 CUP RICOTTA CHEESE

ZEST OF ONE LEMON

A SINGLE NOTE PLAYED ON A GLASS HARMONICA 🔮🎶

ONE TINY BIT OF BACH'S SOUL (OPTIONAL)

ADD TO BATTER FOR LUSH TEXTURE.
LIKE A SMOOTH PARALLEL FIFTH IN DISGUISE.

FINAL THOUGHTS (IN D MINOR, OF COURSE) 🖤

THIS IS MORE THAN A COMPOSITION.
THIS IS A PSYCHOACOUSTIC RITUAL.
A SPECTRAL DANCE IN THE TEMPLE OF TONALITY.
A MADMAN’S WALTZ THROUGH THE VOID BETWEEN ATTACK AND RELEASE.
🎼👁️‍🗨️👂🌀

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
OR INVITED.
OR BOTH.

EITHER WAY—BRING EARPLUGS, A METRONOME, AND AN IRON-STOMACHED LOVE FOR SYNCOPATION.
💀⏰💓
