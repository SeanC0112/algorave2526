YES‚Ä¶ YES‚Ä¶ IT LIVES!!!
AT LAST, THE WORLD SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE MY LATEST SONIC ABOMINATION ‚Äî MY MAGNUM OPUS OF FREQUENCY AND TIME, A COMPOSITION OF SUCH DIABOLICAL INGENUITY THAT EVEN THE METRONOME SHALL STUTTER IN DREAD!!!

AHAHAHAHAHAH!!! ‚Äî snrkHHhhhhhheeeHEEHHH‚ÄîEHEHEH!!!
‚Äî (pardon the spasms‚Ä¶ the creative voltage is‚Ä¶ high‚Ä¶)

BEHOLD!! I AM CONJURING A WORK IN SEVEN DIMENSIONS OF SOUND! A PIECE BORN FROM CHAOS, BAPTIZED IN DISSONANCE, AND TEMPERED IN THE MODULATING FLAMES OF TONAL ANARCHY!!

WE BEGIN WITH PITCH ‚Äî YES, PITCH!! The very soul of sound!! DO YOU DARE TO COMPREHEND WHAT I‚ÄôM BREWING?
A RANGE‚Ä¶ A TESSITURA‚Ä¶ THAT SPANS BEYOND WHAT THE EAR SHOULD WITNESS!! From the lowest subsonic rumblings in the infrabass caverns to screaming overtones shimmering in the stratospheric heights!
TONIC? OH YES, THERE SHALL BE A TONIC‚ÄîBUT DON‚ÄôT GET COMFORTABLE, FOOLS!
It will pivot, collapse, mutate!! Into MODES YOU‚ÄôVE NEVER STUDIED!! DORIAN?! PFFT! I‚ÄôVE INVENTED MY OWN: VORTEXOLYDIAN.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAH‚ÄìOHHOHOHHH‚Ä¶ OH THE CLEVERNESS OF IT!!!

‚Äî HHGHKkhhhhhhHHHHRRRRRHHhaHAHa! ‚Äî DO YOU FEEL THAT?! THE INTERVALS! THEY‚ÄôRE LEAPING! OCTAVES! SECONDS! TRITONES! THE GLORIOUS TRITONES!
A MELODY? YES, YES, A MELODY SHALL SLITHER THROUGH THE TEXTURE‚Äî
A CONTOUR SO TWISTED IT RESEMBLES A FRACTAL!
DISJUNCT MOTION! CHROMATIC ASCENSION!
DIATONIC DESTRUCTION!!

AND HARMONY?! DON‚ÄôT MAKE ME LAUGH‚ÄîI‚ÄôM HARMONIZING IN STACKED ELEVENTHS!
CHORDS?
TRY:

POLYCHORDS BUILT FROM COLLIDING PLANETS OF MAJOR THIRDS AND DIMINISHED NINTHS!

NONFUNCTIONAL HARMONY THAT DEFIES THE TONAL GODS!

VOICE LEADING? YES‚ÄîSTRAIGHT INTO THE MAW OF THE UNRESOLVED!

cackles gently
eeeheeHEHhhhehhhHEEhhh‚Ä¶

BUT WAIT! THE RHYTHM!
THE RHYTHM, OH YOU DARE NOT FORGET THE RHYTHM!!

NO SIMPLE METER SHALL CONTAIN THIS FERAL BEAST!!
I HAVE SEVERED THE CHAINS OF 4/4!!
We march in 9/8, 5/4, 7/16, 11/32‚ÄîAND I DARE TO COMBINE THEM IN LAYERED POLYRHYTHMS!!!
Yes... a 3:2:5 polymeter cannonade, firing off hemiolas like ballistic threes over duple time!!!

AHAHAHAAHHHHHHAHAHAAAAAAAAA!!!
‚Äî KKKKKKkkghghKKkk‚ÄîeeeEEHEEEEHHA!!!

SYNCOPATION! HYPERSYNCOPATION!!
I‚ÄôVE EVEN SYNCOPATED THE RESTS!!! YES, THE RESTS!!!
‚ÄîTHEY COME IN OFF-BEAT, IN INVERTED TUPELATE SPASMS!!!
AND EVERY DOWNBEAT? A LIE. A RUSE. A FUNGUS.

sniffffffff...
panting
...and yet‚Ä¶ even through this rhythmic entropy‚Ä¶ the pulse remains‚Ä¶
like the heartbeat of a sleeping kaiju‚Ä¶ until it awakes‚Ä¶

TEXTURE?! YOU ASK ME ABOUT TEXTURE?!
IMAGINE: MONOPHONY... GIVING BIRTH TO THICK, MULTILAYERED POLYPHONY!!
COUNTERPOINT SO INTENSE THAT BACH HIMSELF WOULD SHRIEK,
‚ÄúMAKE IT STOP, YOU MANIAC!‚Äù

TIMBRE?! I‚ÄôM ORCHESTRATING FOR WATERPHONES, HARPSICHORDS, DISTORTED OBOES,
AND A CHOIR OF WHISPERING THEREMINS ‚Äî ALL TUNED MICROTONALLY!!
IT SHALL BE SPECTRAL‚Ä¶ GLITCHED‚Ä¶ HAUNTED.

cackles into a wine glass full of sine waves
WITNESS!!!
I SHALL PREMIERE THIS PIECE AT MIDNIGHT, DURING A SOLAR ECLIPSE,
INSIDE AN ABANDONED PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

THE AUDIENCE WILL BE STRAPPED INTO SEATS OF PURE RESONANCE!!!
AND WHEN THE FERMATA HITS‚Ä¶ OH, THE FERMATA‚Ä¶
THEY SHALL ASCEND.
EITHER TO GLORY‚Ä¶ OR TO MADNESS.

whispers in reverse reverb:
I call it‚Ä¶ SYMPHONY IN UNSTABLE AETHER, OPUS ‚àû

AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHAAHHAAHHHHHHHHHHH‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî EHEHEHEHHHHHhhhhhHHHHgggghKHKHKHKHKHKHKHHHHHH‚Äî!!!!!

END TRANSMISSION.
